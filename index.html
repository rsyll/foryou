                <p>Dear Babs,</p>
                <p>Feb 27,2025 ...it was such a tiring day until unexpected things happened. 
                    My POV
                    "Who's that guy? Do i need to assist him?" a question running in my mind ..
                    After a few minutes i tried to approach you if u needed my help. But before i tried, you suddenly approached me. 
                    I was just acting that i know you. I talked to you but i was just thinking of who the hell are you and why do u know me. 
                    I looked at your application form while talking to you hoping that i will remember you. After you finish the online
                     application chu¬≤, i suddenly remembered you...i assisted you to the registrar office but  something happened..even though
                      i have something to do in the office, i choose to go with you. 
                    After that, i can't explain what is happening to me. Something i cannot explain. Thennnn............(to be continued)</p>
